# Patched version of Slock by zordsdavini

**To read real Suckless readme read `README`**

Applied patches:
* **capscolor** - Introduces an additional color to indicate the state of Caps Lock
* **Xresources** - as I'm using `pywal` for teminal (Qtile, dmenu and other cool apps) theming, then `slock` can read colours through
  `.Xresources`. To check how to enable see my dotfiles (patch written by zordsdavini)
